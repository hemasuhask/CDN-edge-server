# CDN-edge-server
A Content Delivery Network (CDN) edge server implementation that serves as a caching proxy for web content. The project includes TLS termination, persistent connection management, and intelligent content caching. The server is built with a multi-threaded architecture to handle concurrent client requests efficiently. The implementation features HTTPS support with OpenSSL, enabling secure client connections while the proxy maintains separate HTTPS connections to the origin server. A thread-safe connection pool manages persistent HTTP/1.1 connections to the origin, eliminating the overhead of repeated TLS handshakes. 

Each client request spawns a dedicated thread that handles the full request-response cycle, including parsing HTTP headers, modifying Connection headers for keep-alive behavior, and determining response boundaries using Content-Length headers. The caching layer implements intelligent content storage based on file types and Cache-Control directives, with special handling for query string parameters and the no-store directive. The server outputs detailed request logs including client IP, request line, origin hostname, HTTP status code, and content length for monitoring and debugging purposes.
